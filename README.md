## Software Engineering in 2024

This article from Neurosys talks about ["new software development trends for 2024"](https://neurosys.com/blog/trends-in-software-development). 

Here are some points I find it interesting: 
- AI and ML will become not only a trend but more of the fundamental tools for software developpment in 2024. AI-driven tools increased the capabilities of sofware development and enhance software user experiences. Artificial Intellegence is not here to substitute software engineers but rather assisting them to increase their potentials.
- Other fields such as pharmaceutical industry uses the unique capabilities of quantum computing to simulate molecular interactions for a more efficient research and develop process. By simulating chemical structures in a quantum level, research team can have a more precise target for pharmaceutical compounds, which greatly speeds up the process.

 It's nice to see the narrative shifting from AI as a potential replacement for human jobs to a powerful tool that improves the capabilities of software engineers!
